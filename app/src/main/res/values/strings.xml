MIUI is known for breaking standard Android API features and a lot of MCool users have reported installations failing on MIUI for no reason with \"Installation failed\". Usually it can be fixed by disabling MIUI optimizations in developer settings, which I suggest you should do.\n\nOf course you can try using MCool without disabling MIUI optimization, but if it doesn\'t work, try disabling it before complaining to me about failed installations. If your MIUI version doesn\'t have that toggle or it doesn\'t help, there\'s nothing I can do.\n\nThis issue is supposed to be fixed on MIUI 20.2.20 and up (xiaomi.eu and eu-based ROMs).</string>
